I'll help teach you about terminal text based on the CS50 materials. Here's a guide on terminal text:

# Terminal Text Guide

## What is the Terminal?

The terminal is a text-based interface where you can interact with your computer by typing commands. In CS50, you'll use the terminal to compile and run code, navigate directories, and manage files.

## Basic Terminal Commands

Here are some essential terminal commands:

- `ls` - List files in current directory
- `cd` - Change directory
- `mkdir` - Make a new directory
- `code` - Open VS Code editor (in CS50's environment)
- `make` - Compile a C program
- `./<program>` - Run a compiled program

## Running Programs

To compile and run a C program in the terminal:

```bash
$ make hello
$ ./hello
```

The `$` represents the terminal prompt (don't type this part).

## Command Structure

Terminal commands typically follow this structure:

```bash
command [options] [arguments]
```

For example:

```bash
$ ls -l documents
```

- `ls` is the command
- `-l` is an option (for "long" format)
- `documents` is the argument

## Special Characters

- `.` - Current directory
- `..` - Parent directory
- `~` - Home directory
- `/` - Root directory or path separator

## Useful Tips

- Use Tab for auto-completion
- Use Up/Down arrows to cycle through command history
- Press Ctrl+C to stop a running program
- Press Ctrl+L or type `clear` to clear the screen

Remember that terminal commands are case-sensitive and spacing matters. Would you like me to explain any of these concepts in more detail?
