# CS50 Lecture 0 - Concept Check

## Part 1: Binary & Information Representation

### 1. Convert the binary number 1011 to decimal
- Answer: 11
- Calculation: 2³×1 + 2²×0 + 2¹×1 + 2⁰×1 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11

### 2. How many unique values can be represented with 8 bits?
- Answer: 256 (2⁸)

### 3. True/False: ASCII uses 7 bits to represent characters
- Answer: True (historically)
- Note: Originally conceived as 7-bit code, though modern systems use 8 bits with the 8th bit undefined

### 4. How are colors typically represented in computers?
- Answer: RGB values (Red, Green, Blue)
- Range: 0-255 for each component
- Example: RGB(12, 123, 234)

## Part 2: Algorithms

### 1. Given a phone book with 1000 pages, how many steps would binary search take?
- Answer: ~10 steps
- Explanation: log₂(1000) ≈ 10
- Complexity: O(log n)

### 2. Core building blocks of algorithms
- Sequencing
- Selection
- Iteration

### 3. Key difference between linear and binary search efficiencies
- Linear search: O(n) - grows proportionally with input size
- Binary search: O(log n) - grows logarithmically

## Part 3: Programming Concepts

### 1. Main types of puzzle pieces in Scratch
- I don't care

### 2. Why is abstraction useful in programming?
- Hides implementation complexity
- Simplifies tasks for end users
- Reduces code complexity and reading time
- Makes code more maintainable

### 3. Difference between sprite and function in Scratch
- I don't care

### 4. Difference between "forever" and "repeat" loops
- Forever loop: Equivalent to while(true)
- Repeat loop: Equivalent to for loop with fixed iterations
